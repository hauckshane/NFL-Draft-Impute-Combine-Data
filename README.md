# NFL-Draft-Impute-Combine-Data

This paper aims to predict the potential success of NFL players' careers by analyzing a combination of NFL Combine data, previous college football statistics, and scouting grades. The research focuses on using statistical modeling and machine learning to provide more accurate predictions of a player's potential success in the NFL. However, missing values in the NFL Combine data can make predicting a player's future success challenging. This research employs data imputation techniques to fill in the missing values, with an emphasis on limiting the evaluation of observations to only those from the same position. The study analyzes the effectiveness of various imputation methods for predicting Adjusted Approximate Value (AAV) of NFL draft picks for quarterbacks and wide receivers. The data used in this research is based on NFL prospects prior to the NFL Draft and aims to predict a player's success in the NFL using machine learning techniques. The data was collected from several sources, including Sports References StatHead Football, Sports Reference College Football statistics, ESPN News Archives, and Scouting Report Grades from ESPN. The total number of available players is 6,128, with each year having an average of 323 players, except for 2021, which had a marginally higher number of 400 players. The Sports References StatHead Football dataset provides detailed information about a player's performance in the NFL Scouting Combine, including events such as the forty-yard dash, vertical jump, broad jump, bench press, three cone, and shuttle. The website also provides information about a player's height and weight, which will be important when evaluating player success in Combine events. In addition to analyzing player performance data, this study also utilized sentiment analysis of news articles to evaluate a player's character and off-field incidents. This approach allowed for a more comprehensive evaluation of a player's overall profile beyond just their on-field performance. Furthermore, the study used machine learning techniques to predict player success in the NFL, while also investigating different techniques for imputing missing NFL Scouting Combine data. The combination of these approaches provides a more robust analysis of factors contributing to a player's potential success in the NFL.
